# Pagerank and HITS Algorithm
Constructed Pagerank and HITS algorithm through Julia programming language with 1000+ lines of code. 
Ranked websites based on links that each website contained within their page.
Built a Chrome extension that accurately determined damping factor, the proportion of times that pages are changed by clicking through links over the total number of page changes, and improved Pagerank algorithm.
